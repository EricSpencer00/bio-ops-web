# BioOps — environmental awareness website

This repository contains a starter website for the BioOps brand — an environmental awareness and community engagement project.

Tech stack (starter):
- Vite + React
- Tailwind CSS for styling

This scaffold includes placeholder pages/components and a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the site and can deploy to GitHub Pages.

Quick start (locally):

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes:
- The project contains many placeholders (images, copy, project details). Replace them with real content and images.
- CI workflow `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` builds the site and deploys to GitHub Pages when pushing to `main` (it uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`).

Next steps you might want me to do (I can implement any of these):
- Add routes for individual initiative pages.
- Wire a CMS (e.g., Netlify CMS, Sanity) or Github content-based data.
- Add accessibility and SEO meta tags + sitemap.
